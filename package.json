  "description": "## Overview This project involves creating a Data Filtering/Sorting Website that allows users to interact with data collected from 20 devices (motion, temperature, light) at 10-minute intervals over a 30-day period. Each device will have a unique ID, and users will have the ability to change metadata related to each device, including building name, room name, location, and room type. Users will be able to sort, filter, and summarize this data through a user-friendly interface.",
